Having developed a keen eye for emerging technologies around me, I have always been passionate about exploring the science of computers ever since I was a young kid. I was particularly intrigued by machine learning and artificial intelligence which rapidly became an essential aspect of every technology around us. The idea of a machine being able to perform tasks and think like a human brain is what I find to be an incredible phenomena. I am currently pursuing bachelors of technology in Computer Science in order to explore this field in detail and currently working on projects to get hands on experience in this domain.
